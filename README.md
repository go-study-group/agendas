# The Go Study Group Agendas

This repository has agendas and meeting notes from the [Go Study Groups](https://gophersource.com/study-group).

# Wait, What is the Go Study Group?

The study group is a really casual meeting, similar to an unconference. You donâ€™t need to have experience with Go or public speaking. All you need is a bit of programming experience and an interest to learn about or demonstrate cool stuff related to Go.

Everyone is welcome regardless of background or experience with Go!
